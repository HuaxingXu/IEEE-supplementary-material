In order to run the Matlab scripts you need to install the [Sound Field
Synthesis Toolbox](https://github.com/sfstoolbox/sfs) before. For the listening
examples stored in <code>listening_examples</code> a headphone is needed for
correct reproduction. Note that the best result will be achieved with an AKG
K601, because we applied a headphone compensation filter for this particular
headphone.

The Matlab files <code>fig3.m</code>, <code>fig5.m</code>, and <code>fig6.m</code>
are recreating the corresponding figures from the paper. 

In addition, <code>listening_examples.m</code> generates listening examples for Wave Field Synthesis
and near-field compensated higher order Ambisonicsstored which are stored in the
folder <code>listening_examples/</code>.
The signals were generated by a binaural simulation of a
virtual point source placed at <code>xs = (0,2.5,0) m</code> for a listener
placed at the positon <code>(X,Y,0) m</code> as indicated by the file names. To
achieve this HRTFs from [Wierstorf et al. (2012)](https://dev.qu.tu-berlin.de/projects/measurements/wiki/2010-11-kemar-anechoic)
